# Realtime UI with NextJS and Supabase

Cloned from this project -> [realtime.pablopunk.com](https://realtime.pablopunk.com)

Wanted to play around and make a fun little website for Oktoberfest.

- We can count our drinks
- How many pretzles we see
- There is a bingo
  - everyone has the same tiles, but they are randomised for everyone.

## Quick Start Guide

1. JS (official support)

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/einargudnig/oktoberfest22.git
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

    or

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
